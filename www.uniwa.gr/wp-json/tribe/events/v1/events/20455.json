The combined utilization of digital documentation technologies with innovative analytical and non-destructive techniques, computational and digital techniques and archaeometric methods supports the creation of a transdisciplinary multispectral modelling towards the sustainable preservation of cultural heritage. Innovation is enhancing and revealing a critical dimension of the preservation of cultural heritage along with social participation and communication.<\/p>\n<p><a
